## AI Generated PRs

We have AI agents that are constantly reviewing the documentation and suggesting
improvements in different ways.

So far they:

* Review the documentation every morning and generate a PR with a suggestion on
  a way to improve the documentation

* Monitor PRs getting merged on [Sublayer](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer) and generates a first-pass PR to update the documentation.

## Contributing

All documentation files are written in Markdown and stored in the `docs` directory. To contribute, fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Comments, suggestions, and review of AI generated PRs is also greatly appreciated!
