# Sublayer Documentation

Welcome to the Sublayer documentation, a comprehensive guide for developers to utilize the Sublayer framework for AI-driven applications.

## Overview

Sublayer is a flexible, model-agnostic AI agent framework in Ruby, designed to enable seamless integration with various AI providers and models. It allows developers to define generators and actions to execute automated tasks and processes.

## Version 0.2.7

The Sublayer gem has been updated to version 0.2.7. This update includes several new features and improvements:

- **CLIProject Class**: Introduces the ability to create command-line interface projects using predefined templates.
  - Supports specifying AI providers like OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini.
  - Utilizes AI models such as gpt-4o, claude-3-haiku-20240307, and gemini-1.5-flash-latest.

- **GithubActionProject Class**: Facilitates the creation of projects intended to run as GitHub Actions.
  - Establishes workflows triggered by specific events, with integration for AI tasks.

- **QuickScriptProject Class**: Simplifies the setup of quick script projects using specified AI models.

- **Enhancements**:
  - Updated command generators to optionally create corresponding CLI commands.
  - Improved configurability with the inclusion of more AI model options.

## Getting Started

To begin using Sublayer, install the gem and configure your environment with the appropriate API keys for your chosen AI provider.

```shell
$ gem install sublayer
```

Configure your application by setting your provider:

```ruby
Sublayer.configuration.ai_provider = Sublayer::Providers::OpenAI
Sublayer.configuration.ai_model = "gpt-4o"
```

## Key Features

- **Generators**: Easily create automation scripts and applications using AI-driven generators.
- **Actions**: Execute specific operations as part of your AI workflows, analogous to tools in other frameworks.
- **Agents**: Define autonomous agents that monitor and respond to environment changes or data inputs.
