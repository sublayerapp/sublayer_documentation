# Building Comprehensive Projects with Sublayer

This guide aims to help you construct large-scale projects leveraging the modular capabilities of the Sublayer framework.

## Planning
Before starting with Sublayer, it is crucial to outline your project's requirements, assess the scope, and define the various agents, generators, and actions needed.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Core Agents**: Establish the key operations your system needs and build corresponding agents.
2. **Utilize Generators for Dynamic Content**: Use Sublayer's Generators to create adaptable and dynamic content sections tailored to various criteria.
3. **Integrate Actions**: Incorporate actions to ensure data flows and system operations are executed correctly.

## Example Project Structure
- Define each component's role: 
  - **Generators** for creating data-driven content.
  - **Actions** for executing external tasks or data manipulations.
  - **Agents** to maintain operational oversight and handle event-driven tasks.

## Code Samples
Here's a snippet of organizing large-scale operations using Sublayer agents:
```ruby
class ProjectAgent < Sublayer::Agents::Base
  trigger { Event.new(:project_updated) }
  goal_condition { project.completed? }

  check_status { puts "Checking project status" }
  step { perform_next_action }
end
```

## Testing and Optimization
Conduct extensive testing and optimization to ensure your configured agents and actions perform efficiently under various conditions.

## Conclusion
By following the methods described in this guide, you should be well on your way to crafting comprehensive and efficient projects using the Sublayer framework. Utilize its full potential to adapt to your specific needs at scale.
