# Core Concepts

The Sublayer framework is structured around three primary components: Generators, Actions, and Agents. These components work together to power the framework's LLM-based applications.

- **Generators**: These are responsible for producing specific outputs from given inputs. They handle a single generation task without engaging in complex decision-making. [Learn more about Generators]({% link docs/concepts/generators.md %}).

- **Actions**: Actions carry out specific tasks, such as obtaining inputs for a Generator or using outputs from a Generator. They focus on executing single, defined operations without complex decision-making. [Discover more about Actions]({% link docs/concepts/actions.md %}).

- **Agents**: These act like personal assistants that respond to repetitive tasks or situational changes. By monitoring triggers, evaluating goals, checking status, and executing steps, Agents automate processes efficiently. [Understand more about Agents]({% link docs/concepts/agents.md %}).
