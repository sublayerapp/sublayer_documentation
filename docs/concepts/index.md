# Core Concepts

Core concepts in the Sublayer framework have been enhanced with the release of version 0.2, featuring improved model support and experimental API integrations. The key updates include:

- **gpt-4o Model**: Leveraging gpt-4o provides users with enhanced capabilities, making AI-driven decision-making and content generation faster and more efficient.
- **Gemini API [Experimental]**: The integration of Google's Gemini API, while still experimental, opens up new possibilities for AI interactions with its feature-rich function calling API.

The framework is broken up into three core concepts: Generators, Actions, and Agents.
