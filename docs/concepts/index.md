# Core Concepts

The framework is broken up into three core concepts: Generators, Actions, and Agents.

Browse the links below to go more in depth into each of these concepts:

* [Generators]({% link docs/concepts/generators.md %}): Responsible for producing specific outputs based on given inputs, without performing any complex decision-making or actions.
* [Actions]({% link docs/concepts/actions.md %}): Handle specific operations to either provide inputs for a Generator or utilize the outputs from a Generator.
* [Agents]({% link docs/concepts/agents.md %}): Autonomous units that perform tasks or monitor systems, composed of triggers, goal conditions, status checks, and steps.

Triggers are utilized within Agents to activate them in response to certain events or conditions.
