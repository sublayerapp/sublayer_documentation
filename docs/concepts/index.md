# Core Concepts

The framework is broken up into three core concepts: Generators, Actions, and Agents. Each of these components plays a distinct role in the functionality of a Sublayer application.

Browse the links below to dive deeper into each of these concepts:

* [Generators]({% link docs/concepts/generators.md %}): Responsible for generating outputs based on given inputs, without performing any external actions.
  
* [Actions]({% link docs/concepts/actions.md %}): Perform specific operations either to obtain inputs for Generators or utilize the outputs generated by them.

* [Agents]({% link docs/concepts/agents.md %}): Autonomous entities that perform tasks or monitor systems, using triggers to activate and steps to achieve goals.

## Choose Your AI Model

Sublayer is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing it to work with different AI models. Below you can find the supported LLM providers and how to set them up.

### OpenAI

To use OpenAI models, ensure that you have an OpenAI API key set in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product).

Usage example:
```ruby
Sublayer.configuration.ai_provider = Sublayer::Providers::OpenAI
Sublayer.configuration.ai_model = "gpt-4o"
```

### Claude (Anthropic)

To utilize Claude, make sure your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is set. Visit [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/) for more details.

Usage example:
```ruby
Sublayer.configuration.ai_provider = Sublayer::Providers::Claude
Sublayer.configuration.ai_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
```

### Gemini (Experimental)

The Gemini integration is in beta, not recommended for production. You'll need a `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) for setup.

Usage example:
```ruby
Sublayer.configuration.ai_provider = Sublayer::Providers::Gemini
Sublayer.configuration.ai_model = "gemini-1.5-pro"
```
