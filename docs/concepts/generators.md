# Generators

Generators are responsible for generating specific outputs based on input data. They focus on a single generation task and do not perform any actions or complex decision-making. Generators are the building blocks of the Sublayer framework.

### Try making your own generator:

### [Examples Section](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/tree/main/examples):

* [CodeFromDescriptionGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/code_from_description_generator.rb): Generates code based on a description and the technologies used. Useful in scenarios where you need quick code snippets from textual descriptions.
* [DescriptionFromCodeGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/description_from_code_generator.rb): Generates a description of the code passed in to it. This is perfect for creating documentation or understanding legacy code.
* [CodeFromBlueprintGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/code_from_blueprint_generator.rb): Generates code based on a blueprint, a blueprint description, and a description of the desired code. Ideal for implementing project templates or patterns.
