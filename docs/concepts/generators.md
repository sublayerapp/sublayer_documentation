# Generators

Generators are responsible for generating specific outputs based on input data. They focus on a single generation task and do not perform any actions or complex decision-making. Generators are the building blocks of the Sublayer framework. They utilize the "llm_output_adapter" to define the structure of the generated output, which can be a single string, list of strings, a named structure, or more complex types.

### Key Features:

- **Input Handling**: Generators accept various inputs and transform them into structured prompts for LLMs.
- **Output Adapters**: Use output adapters to define the structure and type of the result generated by the LLM.
- **Prompt Crafting**: Define clear and precise prompts that guide the LLM to produce meaningful outputs.

### Usage Example:

Create a generator to convert a description into code using specified technologies:

```ruby
# ./code_from_description_generator.rb

require "sublayer"

module Sublayer
  module Generators
    class CodeFromDescriptionGenerator < Base
      llm_output_adapter type: :single_string,
                         name: "generated_code",
                         description: "The generated code in the requested language"

      def initialize(description:, technologies:)
        @description = description
        @technologies = technologies
      end

      def generate
        super
      end

      def prompt
        <<-PROMPT
          You are an expert programmer in \#{@technologies.join(", ")}.

          Generate code using the specified technologies: \#{@technologies.join(", ")}.

          Task Description: \#{@description}

          Approach this task with careful analysis and structured thinking.
        PROMPT
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### [Examples](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/tree/main/examples):

* [CodeFromDescriptionGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/code\_from\_description\_generator.rb): Generates code based on a description and the technologies used.
* [DescriptionFromCodeGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/description\_from\_code\_generator.rb): Generates a description of the code passed in to it.
* [CodeFromBlueprintGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/code\_from\_blueprint\_generator.rb): Generates code based on a blueprint, a blueprint description, and a description of the desired code.

Utilize generators to efficiently convert ideas into actionable code segments, automating the generation of structured outputs from specified inputs.
