# Generators

Generators are responsible for generating specific outputs based on input data. They focus on a single generation task and do not perform any actions or complex decision-making. Generators are the building blocks of the Sublayer framework.

## Default AI Model

In version 0.2, the default AI model for generators was updated from 'gpt-4 turbo' to 'gpt-4o'. This change was made to enhance efficiency and output quality. Users are encouraged to review and adjust their configurations if they have specified a particular model to ensure compatibility with the latest model improvements.

### [Examples](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/tree/main/examples):

* [CodeFromDescriptionGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/code\_from\_description\_generator.rb): Generates code based on a description and the technologies used.
* [DescriptionFromCodeGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/description\_from\_code\_generator.rb): Generates a description of the code passed in to it.
* [CodeFromBlueprintGenerator](https://github.com/sublayerapp/sublayer/blob/main/examples/code\_from\_blueprint\_generator.rb): Generates code based on a blueprint, a blueprint description, and a description of the desired code.
