# Core Concepts

The framework is broken up into three core concepts: Generators, Actions, and Agents.

Browse the links below to go more in depth into each of these concepts:

* [Actions]({% link docs/concepts/actions.md %})
* [Agents]({% link docs/concepts/agents.md %})

Additionally, the default AI model `gpt-4o` can be substituted with `gpt-4-turbo` for applications where faster response times are beneficial at the potential cost of slight inconsistency in outputs. Review the [Advanced Configurations]({% link docs/advanced_config.md %}) for guidance on selecting the appropriate model.
