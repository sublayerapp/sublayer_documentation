# Advanced Config

After installing Sublayer, you can choose between any of the available LLM providers we support.

## OpenAI (Default)

Usage:

```ruby
Sublayer.configuration.ai_provider = Sublayer::Providers::OpenAI
Sublayer.configuration.ai_model = "gpt-4o"
```

## Anthropic

Supported Models: Claude 3+ Opus, Claude 3+ Haiku, Claude 3+ Sonnet

Set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. (Visit [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/) to get an API key.)

```

## Google

## Additional AI Model Options for Projects

Recent updates allow for the inclusion of more AI model options across different project types in the Sublayer framework. This enhancement supports:

- CLI Projects using models like `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`, or `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`.
- GithubAction and QuickScript projects leveraging these AI models in their workflows.

Users should configure their environment with the appropriate model and provider settings to maximize the flexibility and power of their Sublayer-enabled applications.
