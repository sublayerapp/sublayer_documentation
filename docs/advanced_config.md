## Custom Generator Setups

### Creating Custom Generators

Custom generators can be tailored for specific needs by modifying the generator's logic, input options, and output formatting to fit your unique data pipelines or application structures.

### Utilizing Different Providers

Sublayer supports a range of providers. You can switch between them or use multiple providers within the same application, depending on the needs of your solution.

### Handling Edge Cases

It's crucial to anticipate and handle edge cases in your generator logic. Implement appropriate error handling and validation to ensure robustness and reliability.

### Example: Integrating a New Provider

Hereâ€™s how you can integrate a hypothetical new provider into your setup:

```ruby
module Sublayer
  module Providers
    class NewProvider
      def self.call(prompt:, output_adapter:)
        # Integration logic for the new provider
      end
    end
  end
end

Sublayer.configuration.ai_provider = Sublayer::Providers::NewProvider
Sublayer.configuration.ai_model = "new-model-1.0"
```

By understanding and utilizing the advanced configurations possible with Sublayer, you can maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of your AI solutions.
