# Advanced Config

After installing Sublayer, you can choose between any of the available LLM providers we support.

## OpenAI (Default)

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. (Visit [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product) to get an API key.)

Usage:

```ruby
Sublayer.configuration.ai_provider = Sublayer::Providers::OpenAI
Sublayer.configuration.ai_model = "gpt-4o"
```

Note: The `gpt-4o` model is the default, but you can choose to use `gpt-4-turbo` for better performance in interactive applications. Depending on your needs, `gpt-4-turbo` might be preferred for scenarios where speed is critical and slight variations in responses are acceptable.

## Anthropic

Set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. (Visit [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/) to get an API key.)
